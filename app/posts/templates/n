Importing the os module in Python provides a way to interact with the operating system. Here are some key uses:

    File and Directory Management: Create, delete, and manage files and directories.
        os.mkdir('dirname') to create a directory.

        os.remove('filename') to delete a file.
        
        os.listdir('path') to list directory contents.

    Environment Variables: Access and set environment variables.
        os.getenv('VAR_NAME') to get an environment variable.
        os.putenv('VAR_NAME', 'value') to set an environment variable.

    Path Manipulations: Manipulate file and directory paths.
        os.path.join('dir', 'file') to join paths in a platform-independent way.
        os.path.exists('path') to check if a path exists.

    Process Management: Manage and interact with system processes.
        os.system('command') to run a system command.
        os.getpid() to get the current process ID.

    Platform Information: Get information about the operating system.
        os.name to get the name of the OS.
        os.uname() to get detailed system information (on Unix systems).

By importing the os module, you gain powerful tools for performing system-level tasks directly from your Python code.
